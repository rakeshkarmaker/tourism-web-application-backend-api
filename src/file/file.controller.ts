// In this controller, we have a POST /file/upload route that accepts a file and a folder name. The file is uploaded using the FileInterceptor, which saves the file to the ./uploads folder. We then call the validateFile method to check if the file meets the requirements (e.g., file type, file size). If the file is valid, we call the processUpload method to process the file and return the result. We also log the file upload status using the Logger service.
